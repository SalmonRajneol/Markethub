# ShawnsWebsite
I have developed a feature-rich dynamic website using PHP and MySQL, showcasing an array of technical proficiencies. My project encompasses a strong foundational grasp of PHP, encompassing fundamental operations and interactivity through user-inputted name and city data. Progressing into the second week, I adeptly incorporated advanced concepts, implementing arrays and functions capable of dynamic sign alteration and Fahrenheit/Celsius temperature conversion. A pivotal juncture arrived in the third week, as I seamlessly integrated the website with a MySQL database, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval functionalities.
