# ShawnsWebsite
I have developed a feature-rich dynamic website using PHP and MySQL, showcasing an array of technical proficiencies. My project encompasses a strong foundational grasp of PHP, encompassing fundamental operations and interactivity through user-inputted name and city data. Progressing into the second week, I adeptly incorporated advanced concepts, implementing arrays and functions capable of dynamic sign alteration and Fahrenheit/Celsius temperature conversion. A pivotal juncture arrived in the third week, as I seamlessly integrated the website with a MySQL database, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval functionalities 
I successfully hosted this dynamic website on 000webhost, utilizing the hosting services provided by Hostinger. This platform allowed for seamless online access to the application, demonstrating my proficiency not only in web development but also in deploying and managing web applications on a live server environment. This project underscores my technical prowess in PHP, MySQL, and web hosting, emphasizing my adeptness in creating dynamic, interactive, and data-driven web applications, primed for professional deployment.
